        <p>“For me, Peru is the molten core of South America, a distillation of the oldest traditions and the finest
          building, weaving and art made by the most sophisticated cultures on the continent. In Peru the wildest
          landscapes – from frozen Andean peaks to the deep Amazon – help us re-forge our connection to the natural
          world. It is also a cultural stew, where diverse peoples live side by side, negotiating modern life with humor
          and aplomb. Beyond that, the cuisine alone makes it worth the trip. Every return is rich and surprising.”</p>

        <p>“When it comes to travel, America has always floored me with its staggering range of possibilities. Not many
          other countries have so much natural beauty – mountains, beaches, rainforest, deserts, canyons, glaciers –
          coupled with fascinating cities to explore, an unrivaled music scene and all the things that make travel so
          rewarding (friendly locals, great restaurants and farmers markets, and plenty of quirky surprises).</p>

      <div class="side top">
        <p>“Its modern face is dazzling, but China is no one-trick pony. The world's oldest continuous civilisation
          isn't all smoked glass and brushed aluminium and while you won't be tripping over artefacts – three decades of
          round-the-clock development and rash town-planning have taken their toll – rich seams of antiquity await.”</p>

        <p>“As I flew north to begin my third circuit of Iceland in four years, I was slightly anxious. The number of
          visitors to Iceland has doubled in that period, and I feared this might mean a little less magic to go around.
          At the end of this trip, 6000km later, I'm thrilled to report that the magic levels remain high. It's found in
          glorious football victories and Viking chants, kayaking among icebergs, sitting with puffins under the
          midnight sun and crunching across brand-new lava fields.”</p>
